## Compatibility guarantees

The compatibility guarantees cover two aspects: upgrades and communication between endpoints in various versions (so called `wire compatibility`).

The recommended approach is to upgrade 1 major version at a time, with deployment to production. That guarantees that the necessary transformations of data are performed and no information will be lost.

The wire compatibility is guaranteed across 1 major version. Additionally, there's the best effort and extensive testing to cover compatibility across all versions, starting with NServiceBus Version 3.
